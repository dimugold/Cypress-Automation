# Cypress Cucumber Project
Welcome to my test project based on [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/). This project is designed to help me practice my skills with Cypress, Cucumber, and the Page Object Model (POM). I will continue to update this GitHub repository as I work on it.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

This will install the required packages, including Faker, Cucumber, and Cypress.

### Running the Tests
